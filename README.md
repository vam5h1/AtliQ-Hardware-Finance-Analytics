## 📌 Project Overview  
This project extends the **Sales Analytics** initiative by adding a **finance layer** to the reporting.  
It introduces **cost metrics** (freight & manufacturing costs) alongside sales data, enabling the creation of **P&L reports** and **Gross Margin analysis** at different time levels (yearly, quarterly, monthly).  

The project uses all datasets from the **Sales Analytics Project**, plus one additional dataset:  
- `fact_sales_monthly_with_cost.zip` → Includes **freight cost** and **manufacturing cost** along with net sales.

## 🎯 Business Purpose & Why This Project  

📊 While sales analytics answers *"what are we selling and where?"*, finance analytics answers *"how profitable are we?"*.  

### Why this project was done:  
- Businesses must track **Profit & Loss (P&L)** to assess true performance, not just revenue.  
- Finance leaders need to measure **Gross Margin %** across **years, quarters, and markets**.  
- Monitoring **cost structures** (freight & manufacturing) helps optimize operations and improve profitability.  
- Executives need clear dashboards to make **data-driven financial decisions**.  

### Who benefits from this project?  
- **Finance Teams** → for budgeting, cost control, profitability tracking.  
- **Executives & Management** → for strategic decision-making.  
- **Operations Teams** → to monitor cost efficiency across divisions & markets.
